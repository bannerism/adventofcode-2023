## Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an annual event organized by Eric Wastl. It runs from December 1st to December 25th, and each day, a new programming puzzle is released. Puzzles can be found on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/)

Real Python has some templates and utils to consider in the future: https://realpython.com/python-advent-of-code/
